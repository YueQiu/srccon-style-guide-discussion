# Style guides (or pattern libraries)

Style guide discussion for SRCCON 2014.

## What is a style guide?

At it's face value, the "style guide" is fairly straightforward; a style guide creates standards and best practices for styling.  But there are two main questions to think about when defining what a style guide is.  The style of what?  And, how are standards and best practices transferred or communicated?

There are many different possibilities of what it is that is being styled.
