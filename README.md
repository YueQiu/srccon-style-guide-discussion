# Style guides (a.k.a. pattern libraries, templates)

This is a style guide collection built on top of Alan Palazzolo's 2014 SRCCON note.

"A style guide creates standards and best practices for a system or set of decisions that are otherwise subjective." -- Alan Palazzolo

This is primiraly a style guide collection of digital interfaces, visualizations and interactives.
